Parameter,Typical Value,Description
UMR length,9 mm / 12 mm,Robot body length designed to match vessel scale.
UMR diameter,3.75 mm,Defines robot size relative to vessel diameter.
Vessel diameter (model),9.5 mm,Experimental vessel size used in simulation.
"Rcyl/Rves (aorta, small UMR)",0.32,Cylinder-to-vessel diameter ratio; affects propulsion.
"Rcyl/Rves (aorta, large UMR)",0.42,Larger UMRs fill more of vessel cross-section.
"Rcyl/Rves (renal, small UMR)",0.56,Indicates greater confinement in narrower vessels.
"Rcyl/Rves (renal, large UMR)",0.75,High ratio leads to wall effect dominance.

"Friction coeff. (aorta, small UMR)",0.8–1.4,Contact resistance in larger vessels.
"Friction coeff. (aorta, large UMR)",0.4–0.74,Lower due to increased clearance.

UMR speed (9 Hz),16–19 mm/s,Robot velocity under 9 Hz actuation.
"Re (9mm, 1Hz, 25°C)",0.53,Low Re flow indicates viscous-dominated dynamics.
"Re (9mm, 9Hz, 25°C)",4.2,Faster actuation increases inertial effects.
